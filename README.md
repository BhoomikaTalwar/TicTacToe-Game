This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using Python. It is designed as a two-player game where players take turns to place their respective marks (X or O) on a 3x3 grid. The game offers an interactive command-line interface and follows the standard Tic-Tac-Toe rules, including win, loss, and draw detection.

Features:
1. Two-player Mode: Players alternate turns, choosing their positions on the grid.
2. Input Validation: Ensures that players cannot overwrite previously chosen positions.
3. Win/Draw Detection: Automatically checks for win conditions or draw after each move.
4. Clear Game Logic: Well-structured code with easy-to-understand logic, suitable for Python beginners.
5. Replay Option: After each game, players can choose to start a new match or exit.

How to Play:
1. Players take turns entering a number (1-9) corresponding to the position they want to place their mark on the 3x3 grid.
2. The game automatically updates the board after each turn and checks for a winner or if the game is a draw.
3. The game ends when a player wins or the grid is fully filled without a winner (draw).
